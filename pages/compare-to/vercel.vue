            What makes Parakeet a great Vercel alternative
        </h1>
        <p>
            Many website owners and startups reach for Vercel as soon as they launch.
            However, there are a few reasons why you should consider using
            Parakeet instead. Here's why

            Parakeet's goal is to make it easy to deploy and manage your website. You can literally deploy your website in 3 clicks. Vercel, however has a learning
            curve and is not as easy to use as Parakeet. There are multiple sidebars and a lot of configuration options, but Parakeet is a lot more intuitive and easy to use.
            This is an example of Vercel's deploy page:

        <p>
            Parakeet's deploy page is much more intuitive and easy to use. Here's an example of Parakeet's deploy page:

        <p>
            Vercel collects user data and logs it. Parakeet collects only basic user data and data you enter into the Parakeet dashboard.

            Vercel also uses Google Analytics, Segment, and other behemoth privacy-invading analytics to collect data about your use of the Site. We, on the other hand,
            use <a href="https://plausible.io" class="link">Plausible</a>, a small privacy-friendly startup to collect data about your use of the Site.

            Vercel uses the massive AWS infrasctructure to host your website. This means bandwidth is limited and latency is high. Parakeet, however, is built on the
            Innatical and Hetzner infrastructure and deployed to a global edge CDN. This means that your website is hosted on the fastest and highest performing servers that load in milliseconds.

        <p>
            Vercel's carbon footprint is high. Parakeet is built on the Innatical and Hetzner infrastructure, which are both carbon neutral. You can check your carbon footprint at <a href="https://websitecarbon.com">websitecarbon.com</a>. This is our website carbon rating:
